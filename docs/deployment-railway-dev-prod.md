# Railway dev + prod environments with prod→dev DB sync

> **Status (2026-06-19): COMPLETE.**
> - ✅ Git branches `prod` + `dev` pushed.
> - ✅ Railway `production` env (backend `backend-production-7b10`, own Postgres,
>   tracks `prod` branch) and forked `dev` env (backend `backend-dev-f94e`, own
>   Postgres, tracks `dev` branch).
> - ✅ **Prod→dev sync verified** — `pg_dump --clean prod | psql dev` run via a
>   `postgres:18-alpine` container; dev mirrored prod (row counts matched).
> - ✅ **Native Railway cron service `db-sync`** in the `dev` env: builds the
>   `deploy/railway-sync/Dockerfile` (pinned via `railway.toml`), `cronSchedule
>   = "0 4 * * *"` UTC, `restartPolicyType = NEVER`. Variables `PROD_DATABASE_URL`
>   (prod `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`) + `DEV_DATABASE_URL` (`${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`).
>   Build SUCCESS; first scheduled run 04:00 UTC.

## Topology

Two git branches, two Railway environments in the `recycle-erp-experiment`
project, each its own backend + Postgres. Prod data flows one-way into dev so
dev runs against realistic data.

```
GitHub branch  prod ───► Railway env "production"  ── backend ── Postgres (prod)
                                                                     │
                                                          nightly    │  pg_dump --clean
                                                          prod→dev    ▼
GitHub branch  dev  ───► Railway env "dev"  ── backend ── Postgres (dev)  ◄── overwritten
                                                  ▲
                                             sync service (cron)
```

- **prod env** tracks the `prod` branch; **dev env** tracks the `dev` branch.
  Each backend auto-deploys when its branch changes (watch patterns scope
  rebuilds to `apps/backend/**` + `packages/shared/**`).
- **Sync is one-directional, prod → dev.** Dev's database is clobbered to mirror
  prod. The job NEVER writes to prod (`deploy/railway-sync/sync.sh` refuses if
  source == target).

## Files in this repo

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `deploy/railway-sync/Dockerfile` | `postgres:18-alpine` sync image |
| `deploy/railway-sync/sync.sh` | `pg_dump --clean prod \| psql dev`, one-way, guarded |

## Provisioning steps (need Railway API access)

### 1. Point production at the `prod` branch

`connect_service_source` on the production backend → repo `JinhuW/recycle_servres_erp`, branch `prod`.

### 2. Fork the dev environment

`create_environment` name `dev`, `source_environment_id` = production env. This
copies the backend + Postgres services into a fresh `dev` environment (new,
empty Postgres volume — it gets filled by the sync).

Then in the **dev** env: `connect_service_source` the dev backend → branch `dev`,
and fix dev-specific vars (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` → the dev frontend origin).

### 3. Expose prod Postgres for cross-environment reads

Cross-environment private DNS isn't available, so the dev sync service reaches
prod over a public TCP proxy: `create_tcp_proxy` on the prod Postgres
(application_port 5432). Build `PROD_DATABASE_URL` from the proxy host/port +
the prod DB credentials.

### 4. Create the sync cron service (in the dev env)

- Source: the `dev` branch; build root `deploy/railway-sync`, Dockerfile `Dockerfile`.
- Cron schedule: e.g. `0 4 * * *` (after the 03:00 backup).
- Restart policy: `NEVER`.
- Variables:
  - `PROD_DATABASE_URL` = prod Postgres via the TCP proxy (step 3)
  - `DEV_DATABASE_URL` = reference `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` (dev env's Postgres)

### 5. Verify

Temporarily clear the cron, deploy once so it runs immediately, read logs for
`[sync] done`, and confirm dev shows prod's row counts. Then restore the schedule.

## Safety notes

- The sync OVERWRITES dev every run — never store dev-only data you can't lose.
- One-directional by construction; the script aborts if `PROD_DATABASE_URL ==
  DEV_DATABASE_URL`.
- Consider a prod **read-only** role for `PROD_DATABASE_URL` so the sync can only
  read prod, not modify it.
- The prod→dev copy includes all prod data — treat the dev DB and its access
  with the same sensitivity as prod.
